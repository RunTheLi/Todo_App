# Todo_App
Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. 
This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.
perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

This project involves creating a task management application (Task Manager), which allows users to:

Add new tasks: Users can enter the task's title, date, and description, and then click a button to save the task.
Edit existing tasks: Users can edit the details of tasks that have already been added.
Delete tasks: When a task is no longer needed, users can delete it.
Save task data in LocalStorage: All task data will be saved in the browser's LocalStorage, so the data remains even after the page is closed.

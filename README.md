# Todo_App
Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.  perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.
